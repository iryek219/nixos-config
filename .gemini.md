# NixOS Multi-Machine Configuration

This directory contains the NixOS configurations for multiple machines, organized to manage system settings, home environments, and secrets across different host environments.

## Directory Structure Overview:

*   `.gitignore`, `.sops.yaml`, `flake.lock`, `flake.nix`, `rebuild.sh`: Core Nix and Git related files for managing and deploying configurations.
*   `home/`: Contains NixOS home-manager configurations, including `default.nix` and `vscode.nix` for user-specific settings.
*   `hosts/`: Defines configurations for individual machines, such as `h-tuf`, `oci-arm`, and `p-wsl`, each with their respective `default.nix` and `hardware-configuration.nix` (where applicable).
*   `modules/`: Reusable NixOS modules like `common.nix` and `wsl.nix` for abstracting common configurations.
*   `outsiders/`: Contains configurations for external tools or environments, such as `home/.emacs-configs/vanilla-emacs/init.el` for Emacs and `python/.envrc`, `python/flake.nix` for Python development environments.
*   `secrets/`: Stores encrypted secrets, specifically `secrets.yaml` managed by sops.
