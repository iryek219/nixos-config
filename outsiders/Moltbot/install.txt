I want to set up nix-moltbot on my machine (macOS or Linux).

Repository: http://github:openclaw/nix-openclaw

What nix-moltbot is:
- Batteries-included Nix package for Moltbot (AI assistant gateway)
- Installs gateway + tools everywhere; macOS app only on macOS
- Runs as a launchd service on macOS, systemd user service on Linux

What I need you to do:
1. Check if Determinate Nix is installed (if not, install it)
2. Create a local flake at ~/code/moltbot-local using templates/agent-first/flake.nix
3. Create a docs dir next to the config (e.g., ~/code/moltbot-local/documents) with AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, TOOLS.md
   - If ~/.moltbot/workspace already has these files, adopt them into the documents dir first
4. Help me create a Telegram bot (@BotFather) and get my chat ID (@userinfobot)
5. Set up secrets (bot token, Anthropic key) - plain files at ~/.secrets/ is fine
6. Fill in the template placeholders and call /etc/nixos/rebuild.sh h-tuf
7. Verify: service running, bot responds to messages

My setup:
- OS: [Linux]
- CPU: [x86_64]
- System: [x86_64-linux]
- Home Manager config name: [not applicable – using Home Manager as NixOS module]

Reference the README and templates/agent-first/flake.nix in the repo for the module options.
